## How to Use

1) You're gonna need [creat an app on the account you're using](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/). It's a "script".

2) Duplicate `config/template.json` into `config/default.json` and start editing `default.json`. Add all the info and start adding chnanels.

3) Make sure you have node.js downloaded, preferably something stable and over v5.0.0

4) cd to the folder (search how to do this online) and then type `node index`. It should say that it has started.

5) Optionally, run it on a server so it can run 24/7

6) Optionally add a phone number to the config and it will text you the link when it posts.

## Contribute

If you want. I'm not picky, considering it's under 100 lines.
